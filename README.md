# WAM ---> GPA Calculator
To determine your Weighted average mark (WAM) and to produce a GPA report, use this calculator.

## Calculation
The calculation used in the WAM calculator:

$$ Sum of (subject credit * mark)  \over sum of (subject credit) $$

## To convert WAM to GPA (Grade Point Average), you can use the following table as reference 

| Grade	| WAM |	Description |	U.S. Grade | GPA |
|-------|-----|-------------|------------|-----|
| HD	| | 80-100    |	High Distinction |	A+ | 4.0 |
| D	| 75-79.9    |	Distinction |	A | 3.5 |
| CR	| 70-74.9    | Credit |	B | 3.0 |
| P	| 65-69.9    |	Pass |	C | 2.5 |
| PC | 50-64.9    | Pass Conceded |	C- | 2.0 |
| F | 0-49.9    |	Failed |	F | 1.0 |

>>> For example, if your WAM is 60, your GPA would be 2.0. Note that the conversion table may vary depending on the institution and country, so you should always check with your university or school to confirm the GPA conversion.
